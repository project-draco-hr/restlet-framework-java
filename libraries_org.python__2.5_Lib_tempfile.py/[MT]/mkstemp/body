Else (the default) the file is opened in binary mode.  On\n    some operating systems, this makes no difference.\n\n    The file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID.\n    If the operating system uses permission bits to indicate whether a\n    file is executable, the file is executable by no one. The file\n    descriptor is not inherited by children of this process.\n\n    Caller is responsible for deleting the file when done with it.\n    "
