When a header line is longer (in characters, with tabs\n        expanded to 8 spaces), than maxheaderlen, the header will be broken on\n        semicolons and continued as per RFC 2822.  If no semicolon is found,\n        then the header is left alone.  Set to zero to disable wrapping\n        headers.  Default is 78, as recommended (but not required by RFC\n        2822.\n        "
