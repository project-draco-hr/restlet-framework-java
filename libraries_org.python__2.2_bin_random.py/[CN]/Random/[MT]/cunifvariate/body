def cunifvariate(self, mean, arc):
    'Circular uniform distribution.\n\n        mean is the mean angle, and arc is the range of the distribution,\n        centered around the mean angle.  Both values must be expressed in\n        radians.  Returned values range between mean - arc/2 and\n        mean + arc/2 and are normalized to between 0 and pi.\n\n        Deprecated in version 2.3.  Use:\n            (mean + arc * (Random.random() - 0.5)) % Math.pi\n\n        '
