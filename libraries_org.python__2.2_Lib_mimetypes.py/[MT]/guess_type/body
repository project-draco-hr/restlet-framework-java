    'Guess the type of a file based on its URL.\n\n    Return value is a tuple (type, encoding) where type is None if the\n    type can\'t be guessed (no or unknown suffix) or a string of the\n    form type/subtype, usable for a MIME Content-type header; and\n    encoding is None for no encoding or the name of the program used\n    to encode (e.g. compress or gzip).  The mappings are table\n    driven.  Encoding suffixes are case sensitive; type suffixes are\n    first tried case sensitive, then case insensitive.\n\n    The suffixes .tgz, .taz and .tz (case sensitive!) are all mapped\n    to ".tar.gz".  (This is table-driven too, using the dictionary\n    suffix_map).\n\n    Optional `strict\' argument when false adds a bunch of commonly found, but\n    non-standard types.\n    '
