' Standard "encodings" Package\n\n    Standard Python encoding modules are stored in this package\n    directory.\n\n    Codec modules must have names corresponding to standard lower-case\n    encoding names with hyphens mapped to underscores, e.g. \'utf-8\' is\n    implemented by the module \'utf_8.py\'.\n\n    Each codec module must export the following interface:\n\n    * getregentry() -> (encoder, decoder, stream_reader, stream_writer)\n    The getregentry() API must return callable objects which adhere to\n    the Python Codec Interface Standard.\n\n    In addition, a module may optionally also define the following\n    APIs which are then used by the package\'s codec search function:\n\n    * getaliases() -> sequence of encoding name strings to use as aliases\n\n    Alias names returned by getaliases() must be standard encoding\n    names as defined above (lower-case, hyphens converted to\n    underscores).\n\nWritten by Marc-Andre Lemburg (mal@lemburg.com).\n\n(c) Copyright CNRI, All Rights Reserved.
