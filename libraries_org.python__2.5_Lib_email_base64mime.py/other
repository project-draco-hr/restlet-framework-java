"Base64 content transfer encoding per RFCs 2045-2047.\n\nThis module handles the content transfer encoding method defined in RFC 2045\nto encode arbitrary 8-bit data using the three 8-bit bytes in four 7-bit\ncharacters encoding known as Base64.\n\nIt is used in the MIME standards for email to attach images, audio, and text\nusing some 8-bit character sets to messages.\n\nThis module provides an interface to encode and decode both headers and bodies\nwith Base64 encoding.\n\nRFC 2045 defines a method for including character set information in an\n`encoded-word' in a header.  This method is commonly used for 8-bit real names\nin To:, From:, Cc:, etc. fields, as well as Subject: lines.\n\nThis module does not do the line wrapping or end-of-line character conversion\nnecessary for proper internationalized headers; it only does dumb encoding and\ndecoding.  To deal with the various line wrapping issues, use the email.Header\nmodule.\n"
