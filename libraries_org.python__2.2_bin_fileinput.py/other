'Helper class to quickly write a loop over all standard input files.\n\nTypical use is:\n\n    import fileinput\n    for line in fileinput.input():\n        process(line)\n\nThis iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:],\ndefaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty.  If a filename is \'-\' it\nis also replaced by sys.stdin.  To specify an alternative list of\nfilenames, pass it as the argument to input().  A single file name is\nalso allowed.\n\nFunctions filename(), lineno() return the filename and cumulative line\nnumber of the line that has just been read; filelineno() returns its\nline number in the current file; isfirstline() returns true iff the\nline just read is the first line of its file; isstdin() returns true\niff the line was read from sys.stdin.  Function nextfile() closes the\ncurrent file so that the next iteration will read the first line from\nthe next file (if any); lines not read from the file will not count\ntowards the cumulative line count; the filename is not changed until\nafter the first line of the next file has been read.  Function close()\ncloses the sequence.\n\nBefore any lines have been read, filename() returns None and both line\nnumbers are zero; nextfile() has no effect.  After all lines have been\nread, filename() and the line number functions return the values\npertaining to the last line read; nextfile() has no effect.\n\nAll files are opened in text mode.  If an I/O error occurs during\nopening or reading a file, the IOError exception is raised.\n\nIf sys.stdin is used more than once, the second and further use will\nreturn no lines, except perhaps for interactive use, or if it has been\nexplicitly reset (e.g. using sys.stdin.seek(0)).\n\nEmpty files are opened and immediately closed; the only time their\npresence in the list of filenames is noticeable at all is when the\nlast file opened is empty.\n\nIt is possible that the last line of a file doesn\'t end in a newline\ncharacter; otherwise lines are returned including the trailing\nnewline.\n\nClass FileInput is the implementation; its methods filename(),\nlineno(), fileline(), isfirstline(), isstdin(), nextfile() and close()\ncorrespond to the functions in the module.  In addition it has a\nreadline() method which returns the next input line, and a\n__getitem__() method which implements the sequence behavior.  The\nsequence must be accessed in strictly sequential order; sequence\naccess and readline() cannot be mixed.\n\nOptional in-place filtering: if the keyword argument inplace=1 is\npassed to input() or to the FileInput constructor, the file is moved\nto a backup file and standard output is directed to the input file.\nThis makes it possible to write a filter that rewrites its input file\nin place.  If the keyword argument backup=".<some extension>" is also\ngiven, it specifies the extension for the backup file, and the backup\nfile remains around; by default, the extension is ".bak" and it is\ndeleted when the output file is closed.  In-place filtering is\ndisabled when standard input is read.  XXX The current implementation\ndoes not work for MS-DOS 8+3 filesystems.\n\nPerformance: this module is unfortunately one of the slower ways of\nprocessing large numbers of input lines.  Nevertheless, a significant\nspeed-up has been obtained by using readlines(bufsize) instead of\nreadline().  A new keyword argument, bufsize=N, is present on the\ninput() function and the FileInput() class to override the default\nbuffer size.\n\nXXX Possible additions:\n\n- optional getopt argument processing\n- specify open mode (\'r\' or \'rb\')\n- fileno()\n- isatty()\n- read(), read(size), even readlines()\n\n'
