    '\n        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.\n\n        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:\n\n        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,\n          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function\n          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible\n          characters, except for at most one splat (\'#\').  It is recommended\n          to leave linejunk None; as of Python 2.3, the underlying\n          SequenceMatcher class has grown an adaptive notion of "noise" lines\n          that\'s better than any static definition the author has ever been\n          able to craft.\n\n        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The\n          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out\n          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include\n          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.\n        '
