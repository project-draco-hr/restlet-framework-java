"A dumb and slow but simple dbm clone.\n\nFor database spam, spam.dir contains the index (a text file),\nspam.bak *may* contain a backup of the index (also a text file),\nwhile spam.dat contains the data (a binary file).\n\nXXX TO DO:\n\n- seems to contain a bug when updating...\n\n- reclaim free space (currently, space once occupied by deleted or expanded\nitems is never reused)\n\n- support concurrent access (currently, if two processes take turns making\nupdates, they can mess up the index)\n\n- support efficient access to large databases (currently, the whole index\nis read when the database is opened, and some updates rewrite the whole index)\n\n- support opening for read-only (flag = 'm')\n\n"
