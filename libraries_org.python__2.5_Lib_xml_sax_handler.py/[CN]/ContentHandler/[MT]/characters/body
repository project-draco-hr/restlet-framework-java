def characters(self, content):
    'Receive notification of character data.\n\n        The Parser will call this method to report each chunk of\n        character data. SAX parsers may return all contiguous\n        character data in a single chunk, or they may split it into\n        several chunks; however, all of the characters in any single\n        event must come from the same external entity so that the\n        Locator provides useful information.'
