def startPrefixMapping(self, prefix, uri):
    'Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping.\n\n        The information from this event is not necessary for normal\n        Namespace processing: the SAX XML reader will automatically\n        replace prefixes for element and attribute names when the\n        http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces feature is true (the\n        default).\n\n        There are cases, however, when applications need to use\n        prefixes in character data or in attribute values, where they\n        cannot safely be expanded automatically; the\n        start/endPrefixMapping event supplies the information to the\n        application to expand prefixes in those contexts itself, if\n        necessary.\n\n        Note that start/endPrefixMapping events are not guaranteed to\n        be properly nested relative to each-other: all\n        startPrefixMapping events will occur before the corresponding\n        startElement event, and all endPrefixMapping events will occur\n        after the corresponding endElement event, but their order is\n        not guaranteed.'
