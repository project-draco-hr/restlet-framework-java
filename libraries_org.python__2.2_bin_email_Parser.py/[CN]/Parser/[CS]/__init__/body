    "Parser of RFC 2822 and MIME email messages.\n\n        Creates an in-memory object tree representing the email message, which\n        can then be manipulated and turned over to a Generator to return the\n        textual representation of the message.\n\n        The string must be formatted as a block of RFC 2822 headers and header\n        continuation lines, optionally preceeded by a `Unix-from' header.  The\n        header block is terminated either by the end of the string or by a\n        blank line.\n\n        _class is the class to instantiate for new message objects when they\n        must be created.  This class must have a constructor that can take\n        zero arguments.  Default is Message.Message.\n\n        Optional strict tells the parser to be strictly RFC compliant or to be\n        more forgiving in parsing of ill-formatted MIME documents.  When\n        non-strict mode is used, the parser will try to make up for missing or\n        erroneous boundaries and other peculiarities seen in the wild.\n        Default is non-strict parsing.\n        "
