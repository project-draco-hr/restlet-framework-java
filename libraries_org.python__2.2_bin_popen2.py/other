'\npopen2.py\n\nImplement popen2 module functionality for Jython.\n\nNote that the popen* methods in this module follow the return value\nordering of the Python popen2.popen* methods:\n\n\tfromChild, toChild = popen2.popen2(...)\n\tfromChild, toChild, errorFromChild = popen2.popen3(...)\n\tfromChildInclError, toChild = popen2.popen4(...)\n\nThe os.popen* methods are more natural as follows:\n\n\ttoChild, fromChild = os.popen2(...)\n\ttoChild, fromChild, errorFromChild = os.popen3(...)\n\ttoChild, fromChildInclError = os.popen4(...)\n\nThe Popen3 and Popen4 classes allow users to poll() or wait() for\nchild processes to terminate.\n'
