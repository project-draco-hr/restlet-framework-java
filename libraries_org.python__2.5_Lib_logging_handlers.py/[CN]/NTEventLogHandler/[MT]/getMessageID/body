def getMessageID(self, record):
    '\n        Return the message ID for the event record. If you are using your\n        own messages, you could do this by having the msg passed to the\n        logger being an ID rather than a formatting string. Then, in here,\n        you could use a dictionary lookup to get the message ID. This\n        version returns 1, which is the base message ID in win32service.pyd.\n        '
    return 1
