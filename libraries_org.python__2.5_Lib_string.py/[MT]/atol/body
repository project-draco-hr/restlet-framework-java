The string s must consist\n    of one or more digits, possibly preceded by a sign.  If base\n    is 0, it is chosen from the leading characters of s, 0 for\n    octal, 0x or 0X for hexadecimal.  If base is 16, a preceding\n    0x or 0X is accepted.  A trailing L or l is not accepted,\n    unless base is 0.\n\n    '
