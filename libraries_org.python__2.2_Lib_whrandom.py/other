"Wichman-Hill random number generator.\n\nWichmann, B. A. & Hill, I. D.

(1985)\n        A remark on Algorithm AS 183\n        Applied Statistics 34 (1985),198-200\n\n\nUSE:\nwhrandom.random()       yields double precision random numbers\n                        uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.\n\nwhrandom.seed(x, y, z)  must be called before whrandom.random()\n                        to seed the generator\n\nThere is also an interface to create multiple independent\nrandom generators, and to choose from other ranges.\n\n\n\nMulti-threading note: the random number generator used here is not\nthread-safe; it is possible that nearly simultaneous calls in\ndifferent theads return the same random value.  To avoid this, you\nhave to use a lock around all calls.  (I didn't want to slow this\ndown in the serial case by using a lock here.)\n"
