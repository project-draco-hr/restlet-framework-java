It is only called if the application's\n        return iterable ('self.result') is an instance of\n        'self.wsgi_file_wrapper'.\n\n        This method should return a true value if it was able to actually\n        transmit the wrapped file-like object using a platform-specific\n        approach.  It should return a false value if normal iteration\n        should be used instead.  An exception can be raised to indicate\n        that transmission was attempted, but failed.\n\n        NOTE: this method should call 'self.send_headers()' if\n        'self.headers_sent' is false and it is going to attempt direct\n        transmission of the file.\n        "
