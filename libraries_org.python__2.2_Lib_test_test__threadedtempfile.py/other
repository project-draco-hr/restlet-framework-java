"\nCreate and delete FILES_PER_THREAD temp files (via tempfile.TemporaryFile)\nin each of NUM_THREADS threads, recording the number of successes and\nfailures.  A failure is a bug in tempfile, and may be due to:\n\n+ Trying to create more than one tempfile with the same name.\n+ Trying to delete a tempfile that doesn't still exist.\n+ Something we've never seen before.\n\nBy default, NUM_THREADS == 20 and FILES_PER_THREAD == 50.  This is enough to\ncreate about 150 failures per run under Win98SE in 2.0, and runs pretty\nquickly. Guido reports needing to boost FILES_PER_THREAD to 500 before\nprovoking a 2.0 failure under Linux.  Run the test alone to boost either\nvia cmdline switches:\n\n-f  FILES_PER_THREAD (int)\n-t  NUM_THREADS (int)\n"
