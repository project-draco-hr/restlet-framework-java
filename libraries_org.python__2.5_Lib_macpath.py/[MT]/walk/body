def walk(top, func, arg):
    "Directory tree walk with callback function.\n\n    For each directory in the directory tree rooted at top (including top\n    itself, but excluding '.' and '..'), call func(arg, dirname, fnames).\n    dirname is the name of the directory, and fnames a list of the names of\n    the files and subdirectories in dirname (excluding '.' and '..').  func\n    may modify the fnames list in-place (e.g. via del or slice assignment),\n    and walk will only recurse into the subdirectories whose names remain in\n    fnames; this can be used to implement a filter, or to impose a specific\n    order of visiting.  No semantics are defined for, or required of, arg,\n    beyond that arg is always passed to func.  It can be used, e.g., to pass\n    a filename pattern, or a mutable object designed to accumulate\n    statistics.  Passing None for arg is common."
