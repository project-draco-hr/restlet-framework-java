'Simple class to read IFF chunks.\n\nAn IFF chunk (used in formats such as AIFF, TIFF, RMFF (RealMedia File\nFormat)) has the following structure:\n\n+----------------+\n| ID (4 bytes)   |\n+----------------+\n| size (4 bytes) |\n+----------------+\n| data           |\n| ...            |\n+----------------+\n\nThe ID is a 4-byte string which identifies the type of chunk.\n\nThe size field (a 32-bit value, encoded using big-endian byte order)\ngives the size of the whole chunk, including the 8-byte header.\n\nUsually an IFF-type file consists of one or more chunks.  The proposed\nusage of the Chunk class defined here is to instantiate an instance at\nthe start of each chunk and read from the instance until it reaches\nthe end, after which a new instance can be instantiated.  At the end\nof the file, creating a new instance will fail with a EOFError\nexception.\n\nUsage:\nwhile 1:\n    try:\n        chunk = Chunk(file)\n    except EOFError:\n        break\n    chunktype = chunk.getname()\n    while 1:\n        data = chunk.read(nbytes)\n        if not data:\n            pass\n        # do something with data\n\nThe interface is file-like.  The implemented methods are:\nread, close, seek, tell, isatty.\nExtra methods are: skip() (called by close, skips to the end of the chunk),\ngetname() (returns the name (ID) of the chunk)\n\nThe __init__ method has one required argument, a file-like object\n(including a chunk instance), and one optional argument, a flag which\nspecifies whether or not chunks are aligned on 2-byte boundaries.  The\ndefault is 1, i.e. aligned.\n'
