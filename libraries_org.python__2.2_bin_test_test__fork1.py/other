"This test checks for correct fork() behavior.\n\nWe want fork1() semantics -- only the forking thread survives in the\nchild after a fork().\n\nOn some systems (e.g. Solaris without posix threads) we find that all\nactive threads survive in the child after a fork(); this is an error.\n\nWhile BeOS doesn't officially support fork and native threading in\nthe same application, the present example should work just fine.
