def help_alias(self):
    print 'alias [name [command [parameter parameter ...] ]]\nCreates an alias called \'name\' the executes \'command\'.  The command\nmust *not* be enclosed in quotes.  Replaceable parameters are\nindicated by %1, %2, and so on, while %* is replaced by all the\nparameters.  If no command is given, the current alias for name\nis shown. If no name is given, all aliases are listed.\n\nAliases may be nested and can contain anything that can be\nlegally typed at the pdb prompt.  Note!  You *can* override\ninternal pdb commands with aliases!  Those internal commands\nare then hidden until the alias is removed.  Aliasing is recursively\napplied to the first word of the command line; all other words\nin the line are left alone.\n\nSome useful aliases (especially when placed in the .pdbrc file) are:\n\n#Print instance variables (usage "pi classInst")\nalias pi for k in %1.__dict__.keys(): print "%1.",k,"=",%1.__dict__[k]\n\n#Print instance variables in self\nalias ps pi self\n'
