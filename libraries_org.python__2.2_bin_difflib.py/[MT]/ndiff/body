    "\n    Compare `a` and `b` (lists of strings); return a `Differ`-style delta.\n\n    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter\n    functions (or None):\n\n    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument, and\n      return true iff the string is junk. The default is module-level function\n      IS_LINE_JUNK, which filters out lines without visible characters, except\n      for at most one splat ('#').\n\n    - charjunk: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The\n      default is module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out\n      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: bad idea to include newline\n      in this!).\n\n    Tools/scripts/ndiff.py is a command-line front-end to this function.\n\n    Example:\n\n    >>> diff = ndiff('one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n'.splitlines(1),\n    ...              'ore\\ntree\\nemu\\n'.splitlines(1))\n    >>> print ''.join(diff),\n    - one\n    ?  ^\n    + ore\n    ?  ^\n    - two\n    - three\n    ?  -\n    + tree\n    + emu\n    "
