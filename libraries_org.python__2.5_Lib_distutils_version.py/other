"Provides classes to represent module version numbers (one class for\neach style of version numbering).  There are currently two such classes\nimplemented: StrictVersion and LooseVersion.\n\nEvery version number class implements the following interface:\n  * the 'parse' method takes a string and parses it to some internal\n    representation; if the string is an invalid version number,\n    'parse' raises a ValueError exception\n  * the class constructor takes an optional string argument which,\n    if supplied, is passed to 'parse'\n  * __str__ reconstructs the string that was passed to 'parse' (or\n    an equivalent string -- ie. one that will generate an equivalent\n    version number instance)\n  * __repr__ generates Python code to recreate the version number instance\n  * __cmp__ compares the current instance with either another instance\n    of the same class or a string (which will be parsed to an instance\n    of the same class, thus must follow the same rules)\n"
