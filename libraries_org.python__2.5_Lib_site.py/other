"Append module search paths for third-party packages to sys.path.\n\n****************************************************************\n* This module is automatically imported during initialization. *\n****************************************************************\n\nIn earlier versions of Python (up to 1.5a3), scripts or modules that\nneeded to use site-specific modules would place ``import site''\nsomewhere near the top of their code.  Because of the automatic\nimport, this is no longer necessary (but code that does it still\nworks).\n\nThis will append site-specific paths to the module search path.  On\nUnix (including Mac OSX), it starts with sys.prefix and\nsys.exec_prefix (if different) and appends\nlib/python<version>/site-packages as well as lib/site-python.\nOn other platforms (such as Windows), it tries each of the\nprefixes directly, as well as with lib/site-packages appended.  The\nresulting directories, if they exist, are appended to sys.path, and\nalso inspected for path configuration files.\n\nA path configuration file is a file whose name has the form\n<package>.pth; its contents are additional directories (one per line)\nto be added to sys.path.  Non-existing directories (or\nnon-directories) are never added to sys.path; no directory is added to\nsys.path more than once.  Blank lines and lines beginning with\n'#' are skipped. Lines starting with 'import' are executed.\n\nFor example, suppose sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix are set to\n/usr/local and there is a directory /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages\nwith three subdirectories, foo, bar and spam, and two path\nconfiguration files, foo.pth and bar.pth.  Assume foo.pth contains the\nfollowing:\n\n  # foo package configuration\n  foo\n  bar\n  bletch\n\nand bar.pth contains:\n\n  # bar package configuration\n  bar\n\nThen the following directories are added to sys.path, in this order:\n\n  /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/bar\n  /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/foo\n\nNote that bletch is omitted because it doesn't exist; bar precedes foo\nbecause bar.pth comes alphabetically before foo.pth; and spam is\nomitted because it is not mentioned in either path configuration file.\n\nAfter these path manipulations, an attempt is made to import a module\nnamed sitecustomize, which can perform arbitrary additional\nsite-specific customizations.  If this import fails with an\nImportError exception, it is silently ignored.\n\n"
