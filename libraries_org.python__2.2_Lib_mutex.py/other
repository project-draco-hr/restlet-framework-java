"Mutual exclusion -- for use with module sched\n\nA mutex has two pieces of state -- a 'locked' bit and a queue.\nWhen the mutex is not locked, the queue is empty.\nOtherwise, the queue contains 0 or more (function, argument) pairs\nrepresenting functions (or methods) waiting to acquire the lock.\nWhen the mutex is unlocked while the queue is not empty,\nthe first queue entry is removed and its function(argument) pair called,\nimplying it now has the lock.\n\nOf course, no multi-threading is implied -- hence the funny interface\nfor lock, where a function is called once the lock is aquired.\n"
