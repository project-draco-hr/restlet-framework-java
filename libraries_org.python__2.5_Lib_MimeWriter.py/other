"Generic MIME writer.\n\nThis module defines the class MimeWriter.  The MimeWriter class implements\na basic formatter for creating MIME multi-part files.  It doesn't seek around\nthe output file nor does it use large amounts of buffer space. You must write\nthe parts out in the order that they should occur in the final file.\nMimeWriter does buffer the headers you add, allowing you to rearrange their\norder.\n\n"
