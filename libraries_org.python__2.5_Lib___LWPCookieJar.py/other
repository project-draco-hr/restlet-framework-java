'Load / save to libwww-perl (LWP) format files.\n\nActually, the format is slightly extended from that used by LWP\'s\n(libwww-perl\'s) HTTP::Cookies, to avoid losing some RFC 2965 information\nnot recorded by LWP.\n\nIt uses the version string "2.0", though really there isn\'t an LWP Cookies\n2.0 format.  This indicates that there is extra information in here\n(domain_dot and # port_spec) while still being compatible with\nlibwww-perl, I hope.\n\n'
