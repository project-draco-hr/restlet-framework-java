def skippedEntity(self, name):
    'Receive notification of a skipped entity.\n\n        The Parser will invoke this method once for each entity\n        skipped. Non-validating processors may skip entities if they\n        have not seen the declarations (because, for example, the\n        entity was declared in an external DTD subset). All processors\n        may skip external entities, depending on the values of the\n        http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities and the\n        http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities\n        properties.'
