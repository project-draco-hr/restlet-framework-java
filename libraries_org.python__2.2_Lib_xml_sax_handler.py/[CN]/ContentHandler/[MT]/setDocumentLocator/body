Typically, the application will use\n        this information for reporting its own errors (such as\n        character content that does not match an application's\n        business rules). The information returned by the locator is\n        probably not sufficient for use with a search engine.\n\n        Note that the locator will return correct information only\n        during the invocation of the events in this interface. The\n        application should not attempt to use it at any other time."
