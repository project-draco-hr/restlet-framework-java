def ignorableWhitespace(self, whitespace):
    'Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content.\n\n        Validating Parsers must use this method to report each chunk\n        of ignorable whitespace (see the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation,\n        section 2.10): non-validating parsers may also use this method\n        if they are capable of parsing and using content models.\n\n        SAX parsers may return all contiguous whitespace in a single\n        chunk, or they may split it into several chunks; however, all\n        of the characters in any single event must come from the same\n        external entity, so that the Locator provides useful\n        information.\n\n        The application must not attempt to read from the array\n        outside of the specified range.'
