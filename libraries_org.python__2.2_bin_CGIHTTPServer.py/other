"CGI-savvy HTTP Server.\n\nThis module builds on SimpleHTTPServer by implementing GET and POST\nrequests to cgi-bin scripts.\n\nIf the os.fork() function is not present (e.g. on Windows),\nos.popen2() is used as a fallback, with slightly altered semantics; if\nthat function is not present either (e.g. on Macintosh), only Python\nscripts are supported, and they are executed by the current process.\n\nIn all cases, the implementation is intentionally naive -- all\nrequests are executed sychronously.\n\nSECURITY WARNING: DON'T USE THIS CODE UNLESS YOU ARE INSIDE A FIREWALL\n-- it may execute arbitrary Python code or external programs.\n\n"
