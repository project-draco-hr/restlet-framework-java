    "Call timeit() a few times.\n\n        This is a convenience function that calls the timeit()\n        repeatedly, returning a list of results.  The first argument\n        specifies how many times to call timeit(), defaulting to 3;\n        the second argument specifies the timer argument, defaulting\n        to one million.\n\n        Note: it's tempting to calculate mean and standard deviation\n        from the result vector and report these.  However, this is not\n        very useful.  In a typical case, the lowest value gives a\n        lower bound for how fast your machine can run the given code\n        snippet; higher values in the result vector are typically not\n        caused by variability in Python's speed, but by other\n        processes interfering with your timing accuracy.  So the min()\n        of the result is probably the only number you should be\n        interested in.  After that, you should look at the entire\n        vector and apply common sense rather than statistics.\n        "
