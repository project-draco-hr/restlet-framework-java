'\nSome time zone algebra.  For a datetime x, let\n    x.n = x stripped of its timezone -- its naive time.\n    x.o = x.utcoffset(), and assuming that doesn\'t raise an exception or\n          return None\n    x.d = x.dst(), and assuming that doesn\'t raise an exception or\n          return None\n    x.s = x\'s standard offset, x.o - x.d\n\nNow some derived rules, where k is a duration (timedelta).\n\n1. x.o = x.s + x.d\n   This follows from the definition of x.s.\n\n2. If x and y have the same tzinfo member, x.s = y.s.\n   This is actually a requirement, an assumption we need to make about\n   sane tzinfo classes.\n\n3. The naive UTC time corresponding to x is x.n - x.o.\n   This is again a requirement for a sane tzinfo class.\n\n4. (x+k).s = x.s\n   This follows from #2, and that datimetimetz+timedelta preserves tzinfo.\n\n5. (x+k).n = x.n + k\n   Again follows from how arithmetic is defined.\n\nNow we can explain tz.fromutc(x).  Let\'s assume it\'s an interesting case\n(meaning that the various tzinfo methods exist, and don\'t blow up or return\nNone when called).\n\nThe function wants to return a datetime y with timezone tz, equivalent to x.\nx is already in UTC.\n\nBy #3, we want\n\n    y.n - y.o = x.n                             [1]\n\nThe algorithm starts by attaching tz to x.n, and calling that y.  So\nx.n = y.n at the start.  Then it wants to add a duration k to y, so that [1]\nbecomes true; in effect, we want to solve [2] for k:\n\n   (y+k).n - (y+k).o = x.n                      [2]\n\nBy #1, this is the same as\n\n   (y+k).n - ((y+k).s + (y+k).d) = x.n          [3]\n\nBy #5, (y+k).n = y.n + k, which equals x.n + k because x.n=y.n at the start.\nSubstituting that into [3],\n\n   x.n + k - (y+k).s - (y+k).d = x.n; the x.n terms cancel, leaving\n   k - (y+k).s - (y+k).d = 0; rearranging,\n   k = (y+k).s - (y+k).d; by #4, (y+k).s == y.s, so\n   k = y.s - (y+k).d\n\nOn the RHS, (y+k).d can\'t be computed directly, but y.s can be, and we\napproximate k by ignoring the (y+k).d term at first.  Note that k can\'t be\nvery large, since all offset-returning methods return a duration of magnitude\nless than 24 hours.  For that reason, if y is firmly in std time, (y+k).d must\nbe 0, so ignoring it has no consequence then.\n\nIn any case, the new value is\n\n    z = y + y.s                                 [4]\n\nIt\'s helpful to step back at look at [4] from a higher level:  it\'s simply\nmapping from UTC to tz\'s standard time.\n\nAt this point, if\n\n    z.n - z.o = x.n                             [5]\n\nwe have an equivalent time, and are almost done.  The insecurity here is\nat the start of daylight time.  Picture US Eastern for concreteness.  The wall\ntime jumps from 1:59 to 3:00, and wall hours of the form 2:MM don\'t make good\nsense then.  The docs ask that an Eastern tzinfo class consider such a time to\nbe EDT (because it\'s "after 2"), which is a redundant spelling of 1:MM EST\non the day DST starts.  We want to return the 1:MM EST spelling because that\'s\nthe only spelling that makes sense on the local wall clock.\n\nIn fact, if [5] holds at this point, we do have the standard-time spelling,\nbut that takes a bit of proof.  We first prove a stronger result.  What\'s the\ndifference between the LHS and RHS of [5]?  Let\n\n    diff = x.n - (z.n - z.o)                    [6]\n\nNow\n    z.n =                       by [4]\n    (y + y.s).n =               by #5\n    y.n + y.s =                 since y.n = x.n\n    x.n + y.s =                 since z and y are have the same tzinfo member,\n                                    y.s = z.s by #2\n    x.n + z.s\n\nPlugging that back into [6] gives\n\n    diff =\n    x.n - ((x.n + z.s) - z.o) =     expanding\n    x.n - x.n - z.s + z.o =         cancelling\n    - z.s + z.o =                   by #2\n    z.d\n\nSo diff = z.d.\n\nIf [5] is true now, diff = 0, so z.d = 0 too, and we have the standard-time\nspelling we wanted in the endcase described above.  We\'re done.  Contrarily,\nif z.d = 0, then we have a UTC equivalent, and are also done.\n\nIf [5] is not true now, diff = z.d != 0, and z.d is the offset we need to\nadd to z (in effect, z is in tz\'s standard time, and we need to shift the\nlocal clock into tz\'s daylight time).\n\nLet\n\n    z\' = z + z.d = z + diff                     [7]\n\nand we can again ask whether\n\n    z\'.n - z\'.o = x.n                           [8]\n\nIf so, we\'re done.  If not, the tzinfo class is insane, according to the\nassumptions we\'ve made.  This also requires a bit of proof.  As before, let\'s\ncompute the difference between the LHS and RHS of [8] (and skipping some of\nthe justifications for the kinds of substitutions we\'ve done several times\nalready):\n\n    diff\' = x.n - (z\'.n - z\'.o) =           replacing z\'.n via [7]\n            x.n  - (z.n + diff - z\'.o) =    replacing diff via [6]\n            x.n - (z.n + x.n - (z.n - z.o) - z\'.o) =\n            x.n - z.n - x.n + z.n - z.o + z\'.o =    cancel x.n\n            - z.n + z.n - z.o + z\'.o =              cancel z.n\n            - z.o + z\'.o =                      #1 twice\n            -z.s - z.d + z\'.s + z\'.d =          z and z\' have same tzinfo\n            z\'.d - z.d\n\nSo z\' is UTC-equivalent to x iff z\'.d = z.d at this point.  If they are equal,\nwe\'ve found the UTC-equivalent so are done.  In fact, we stop with [7] and\nreturn z\', not bothering to compute z\'.d.\n\nHow could z.d and z\'d differ?  z\' = z + z.d [7], so merely moving z\' by\na dst() offset, and starting *from* a time already in DST (we know z.d != 0),\nwould have to change the result dst() returns:  we start in DST, and moving\na little further into it takes us out of DST.\n\nThere isn\'t a sane case where this can happen.  The closest it gets is at\nthe end of DST, where there\'s an hour in UTC with no spelling in a hybrid\ntzinfo class.  In US Eastern, that\'s 5:MM UTC = 0:MM EST = 1:MM EDT.  During\nthat hour, on an Eastern clock 1:MM is taken as being in standard time (6:MM\nUTC) because the docs insist on that, but 0:MM is taken as being in daylight\ntime (4:MM UTC).  There is no local time mapping to 5:MM UTC.  The local\nclock jumps from 1:59 back to 1:00 again, and repeats the 1:MM hour in\nstandard time.  Since that\'s what the local clock *does*, we want to map both\nUTC hours 5:MM and 6:MM to 1:MM Eastern.  The result is ambiguous\nin local time, but so it goes -- it\'s the way the local clock works.\n\nWhen x = 5:MM UTC is the input to this algorithm, x.o=0, y.o=-5 and y.d=0,\nso z=0:MM.  z.d=60 (minutes) then, so [5] doesn\'t hold and we keep going.\nz\' = z + z.d = 1:MM then, and z\'.d=0, and z\'.d - z.d = -60 != 0 so [8]\n(correctly) concludes that z\' is not UTC-equivalent to x.\n\nBecause we know z.d said z was in daylight time (else [5] would have held and\nwe would have stopped then), and we know z.d != z\'.d (else [8] would have held\nand we we have stopped then), and there are only 2 possible values dst() can\nreturn in Eastern, it follows that z\'.d must be 0 (which it is in the example,\nbut the reasoning doesn\'t depend on the example -- it depends on there being\ntwo possible dst() outcomes, one zero and the other non-zero).  Therefore\nz\' must be in standard time, and is the spelling we want in this case.\n\nNote again that z\' is not UTC-equivalent as far as the hybrid tzinfo class is\nconcerned (because it takes z\' as being in standard time rather than the\ndaylight time we intend here), but returning it gives the real-life "local\nclock repeats an hour" behavior when mapping the "unspellable" UTC hour into\ntz.\n\nWhen the input is 6:MM, z=1:MM and z.d=0, and we stop at once, again with\nthe 1:MM standard time spelling we want.\n\nSo how can this break?  One of the assumptions must be violated.  Two\npossibilities:\n\n1) [2] effectively says that y.s is invariant across all y belong to a given\n   time zone.  This isn\'t true if, for political reasons or continental drift,\n   a region decides to change its base offset from UTC.\n\n2) There may be versions of "double daylight" time where the tail end of\n   the analysis gives up a step too early.  I haven\'t thought about that\n   enough to say.\n\nIn any case, it\'s clear that the default fromutc() is strong enough to handle\n"almost all" time zones:  so long as the standard offset is invariant, it\ndoesn\'t matter if daylight time transition points change from year to year, or\nif daylight time is skipped in some years; it doesn\'t matter how large or\nsmall dst() may get within its bounds; and it doesn\'t even matter if some\nperverse time zone returns a negative dst()).  So a breaking case must be\npretty bizarre, and a tzinfo subclass can override fromutc() if it is.\n'
